Build Instructions:

1. The startup project is set as Executive. Paths for the required XML files to run this
   project are set for execution through command line. Make sure to run compile.bat first.

2. In order to build this project through visual studio you have to make the following changes in 
   path location:
   
   Go to run.cpp file and change path from:
   a) Line 242, change src2 path from "XmlFiles/lect.xml"  to "../XmlFiles/lect.xml".
   b) Line 286, change src2 path from "XmlFiles/widget.xml" to "../XmlFiles/widget.xml".
   c) Line 397, change src path from "XmlFiles/MainXml.xml to ../XmlFiles/MainXml.xml.

   Go to NoSqlDb.h file and change path from:
   a) Line 328, change path from "PersistedData/" + filename + ".xml" to "../PersistedData/" + filename + ".xml"

 3. Note: first run compile.bat and then run.bat. Executive.exe will only get updated after 
    compiling once.

 4. While testing  any other projects set all other projects to static library after undefining 
    their test stubs.



NOTE: ALL PERSISTED XMLS ARE AVAILABLE IN PersistedData FOLDER.
      ALL THE XMLS FOR AUGMENTING DATABASE ARE FETCHED FROM XmlFiles FOLDER.


 5. TIMED PERSISTANCE IS SET OFF BY DEFAULT (in lines 259,304). After making changes save project
    and compile once before running in command line.
